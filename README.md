# Decentralized Healthcare Records System

A secure, HIPAA-compliant blockchain platform for managing electronic health records (EHR) with granular access control, appointment management, and privacy-preserving research data sharing.

## Overview

This system provides a decentralized infrastructure for storing and managing healthcare records while ensuring patient privacy, regulatory compliance, and secure data sharing between healthcare providers, patients, and researchers.

## Core Components

### Patient Record Contract

- Version control system
- Emergency access protocol
- Data integrity verification
- Audit trail logging
- Record recovery mechanism
- HIPAA compliance features

### Access Control Contract
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Temporal access management
- Consent management system
- Provider credentials verification
- Access revocation system
- Delegation mechanisms
- Emergency override protocols

### Appointment Contract
- Scheduling management
- Payment processing
- Insurance verification
- Appointment confirmation
- Cancellation handling
- Reminder system

### Research Data Contract
- Data anonymization
- Consent tracking
- Usage monitoring
- Data aggregation
- Privacy preservation
- Research access management
- Compensation distribution

## Technical Requirements

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Node.js â‰¥16.0.0
- IPFS for distributed storage
- Hardware Security Module (HSM)

## Patient Features

### Record Management
```solidity
function addHealthRecord(
    bytes32 _recordHash,
    string memory _metadata,
    address[] memory _authorizedViewers
) external;

function grantAccess(
    address _provider,
    uint256 _duration,
    uint8 _accessLevel
) external;
```

### Appointment Scheduling
```solidity
function scheduleAppointment(
    address _provider,
    uint256 _timestamp,
    bytes32 _reasonHash
) external payable;
```

## Healthcare Provider Features

### Record Access
```solidity
function accessPatientRecord(
    address _patient,
    bytes32 _recordId
) external view returns (bytes memory);
```

### Record Updates
```solidity
function updateHealthRecord(
    address _patient,
    bytes32 _recordId,
    bytes32 _newDataHash
) external;
```

## Research Data Sharing

### Data Anonymization
- Differential privacy
- Data generalization
- Identifier removal
- Statistical noise addition
- K-anonymity preservation

### Consent Management
- Granular consent options
- Purpose specification
- Duration limits
- Usage restrictions
- Withdrawal mechanism

## Emergency Access Protocol

1. Emergency trigger activation
2. Temporary access grant
3. Automatic notification
4. Access logging
5. Post-event review
6. Access revocation

## Data Recovery Procedures

1. Multi-signature recovery
2. Backup key usage
3. Identity verification
4. Access restoration
5. Audit trail review

## Testing

```bash
# Run privacy tests
npm run test:privacy

# Run security tests
npm run test:security

# Run compliance tests
npm run test:compliance
```
